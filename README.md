odin-recipes exercise


so this is the prologue i guess, what this project is going to be i don't know just yet, ovbiously going by name it's going to be the first html website i creat that will probably have an index and then other pages of recipes i guess. maybe pictures will be added and a list of ingredients? probably, maybe even an organised list of steps to make the dish?

then links to go back to the index that holds all the other links to the different dishes. if we want to make it a bit more complicated i guess, we can have sub-categories, for example a head that holds several links to dishes inside but they are all under the pasta?/bread? not quite... dough!
then meat, vegies... you get the drift? 

maybe i'll add a conclusion at the end to the readme file if i got it wrong and draw conclusions. ah, no pun intended. lets start, <!--23/02/2023-->
